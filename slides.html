	  <h1>Exploratory data analysis</h1>
	</section>

	<section>
	  Data formats
	  <p> screen shot? </p>
	  <aside class="notes">
	    Let's start with the data.  There are a number of different formats your data can be in.  These include the ever-present excel spreadsheet, a csv (comma-separated values) file, a tsv (tab-separated values) file, JSON, and more.
	  </aside>
	</section>

	<section>
	  Databases:
	  Relational, noSQL, distributed, graph, in-memory
	  <aside class="notes">
	    The format of your data might depend on its source.  There are many different types of databases.  One common type is a relational database, which focuses on the relationships between the data.  Examples include mySQL, SQL Server, MS Access, PostgreSQL.  This type of database requires normalization, which means that different related tables are joined (linked) so that there is no redundancy.  While this helps with data integrity, it can make the database requests slow.  An alternative would be a noSQL database, such as MongoDB, Redis, Apache Cassandra, HBase.  They do not require normalized data and therefore are known for being very fast.
	  </aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		Dataframes:
		samples pandas code to load in data and describe
		<aside class="notes">
			No matter what type of data format you're working with, you can load it into a dataframe.  Both R and the python package pandas have this type of data structure, which is pretty much a table.  You have rows, and columns and headers, like your data has.  Here's an example of a pandas data frame.  Pandas also comes with built-in functions to describe your data.
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		Plotting
		plot
		<aside class="notes">
			Another way to explore your data is through plots.  There are some things that may be hard to see from summary statistics, but very obvious from a graph, like outliers and seasonality.  Matplotlib is a python package for plotting data.
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
	  Data Issues: typos, missing data, redundant data, format issues, outliers
	  <aside class="notes">
		  While you're exploring your data, you may notice some issues.  There may be typos, missing data, redundant data, format issues, or outliers.  When you notice these issues, the first step is to discuss with data provider.  You want to know things like how the data was collected, what exactly it is (sometimes the column names are misleading), if any of the data is stale or deprecated (sometimes one column was deprecated, but left in database, and replaced by a more accurate column).  This information will help you decide how to handle the various issues with the data.

	  Example Data:
	  Small group discussion

	  		Now we're going to do a little small group exercise.  You can work with the person next to you.  Here is an example of some data with issues.  We'll give you about 5 minutes to look at it and come up with some issues that you can see.

	  <h1>Predictive analytics and machine learning</h1>

	<section>
	  You’d like to predict whether customer activity is fraudulent. What are the steps?
	  Definitions
	  Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, statistical modeling, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics
	  The biggest difference I see between the communities is that statistics emphasizes inference, whereas machine learning emphasized prediction. When you do statistics, you want to infer the process by which data you have was generated. When you do machine learning, you want to know how you can predict what future data will look like w.r.t. some variable.
	  http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/6/the-two-cultures-statistics-vs-machine-learning
	  We’ll focus on supervised learning

	  categorical, metric, ordinal
	  y can be categorical (classification) or numeric (regression)

	  <h1>Testing and Experimentation</h1>
	</section>
	<section>
		<blockquote cite="https://hbr.org/2014/02/ab-testing-and-the-benefits-of-an-experimentation-culture/">
	    	&ldquo;Modern tech companies have figured out that data is their product. Whether you sell a service, a product, or content, what you really do is create value for your customer base — and every interaction with your product is a measurable amount of value. But the best data-driven companies don’t just passively store and analyze data, they actively generate actionable data by running experiments. The secret to getting value from data is testing, and if you’re looking to grow your online business, implementing well-executed, consistent A/B testing is a necessity.&rdquo;
	  </blockquote>
	  <aside class="notes">
	  		Another important area of data science is experimentation and testing.  This could be done in order to gather the data that you will use to model, or it could be done to test the predictions that your model output.  Or it could be done instead of creating a model.  Here's a quote from a HBR article from last year, that emphasizes the importance of testing, specifically A/B testing.

		<aside class="notes">
			So what is A/B testing?  A/B testing is an experiementation technique where you show some customers one thing (version A) and other customers another (version B).  It's commonly used in web analytics, where a company would show some percentage of the visitors to its website one layout or color scheme or ad, and others a slightly different one.  You typically want to keep the rest of the content the same, so that you can attribute the difference in click-throughs to the the change you're testing.
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		What NOT to do
		<aside class="notes">
			One of the most important things to keep in mind when A/B testing is when to stop.  Generally, you want to stop testing when you reach a certain level of statistical significance.  However, this should be calculated beforehand.  Often people "peek" at their current significance, and stop when they reach a certain level.  However, this might be influenced by a current streak, for example, so it would be misleading.  So, you should calculate your sample size, based on your desired level of significance, beforehand and do not stop early.

		Multi-Armed Bandit
		<br>
		<img src="http://www.residentialgolflessons.com/multimedia/gallery/3799_mills-golden-nugget-bandit.jpg">
		<aside class="notes">
			One common situation that's related to A/B testing is the multi-armed bandit problem.  The name comes from the idea of a slot machine or "one-armed bandit" having two arms to pull.  You may have some hypothesis of which arm would have the bigger reward, but you need to come up with a strategy that effectively tests your theory and also maximizes the reward.  So in terms of A/B testing in online ads, you would want to choose the perecentage of website visitors to show each ad that provides enough data to give confidence to your findings but also maximize click-throughs in the process.

			There are a number of different strategies you can take here.  The simpliest is called epsilon-greedy, which assigns a fixed percentage (say 90%) of the visitors to the ad that is expected to have the higher reward.  But in order to gain more information about the other ad, you may consider a probability matching strategy, such as the Bayesian bandit strategy.  You can use Bayes Theorem to come up with a

		<aside class="notes">
			An alternative to A/B testing is multivariate testing.  As the name suggests, multivariate testing tests multiple variables at the same time.  You can use a full factorial method, which would test every combination of the changes, or a partial factorial method, which would only test a fraction of the combinations and infer the rest.  While you can learn more about the effectiveness of each variable, the testing is more complex and requires more data (visitors) than A/B testing, which is sometimes not worth the effort.

	  <h1>Data communication and visualization</h1>
	</section>

	<section>
	  Communication is critical for data science
	  Must be able to communicate a model to a customer/non-technical team
	  If the model does not get used/implemented, it does not add value
	  Tip 1: start simple, super simple, maintainability
	  CEO should be able to understand it (at a high level)
	  Tip 2: Translate model results into business value, ROI, etc.
	  Tip 3: Create great charts Visualization - the basics
