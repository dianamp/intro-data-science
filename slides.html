	  Why is data science important?
	  “The sexiest job of the century” quote
	  https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/
	  Content: People are saving their data, computing power, scarcity issue, big demand because applicable to every industry, super fun

	<section>
	  <h2>Big Data</h2>
	  Definition: when you have more data than can be worked with on your laptop
	  Implications: distributed systems, distributed databases, map reduce
	</section>

	<section>
	  What do data scientists do? Aka agenda:
	  Exploratory data analysis
	  predictive analytics and machine learning
	  A/B testing, etc
	  Data communication and visualization
	</section>

	<section>
	  <h1>Exploratory data analysis</h1>
	</section>

	<section>
	  Data formats
	  <p> screen shot? </p>
	  <aside class="notes">
	    Let's start with the data.  There are a number of different formats your data can be in.  These include the ever-present excel spreadsheet, a csv (comma-separated values) file, a tsv (tab-separated values) file, JSON, and more.
	  </aside>
	</section>

	<section>
	  Databases:
	  Relational, noSQL, distributed, graph, in-memory
	  <aside class="notes">
	    The format of your data might depend on its source.  There are many different types of databases.  One common type is a relational database, which focuses on the relationships between the data.  Examples include mySQL, SQL Server, MS Access, PostgreSQL.  This type of database requires normalization, which means that different related tables are joined (linked) so that there is no redundancy.  While this helps with data integrity, it can make the database requests slow.  An alternative would be a noSQL database, such as MongoDB, Redis, Apache Cassandra, HBase.  They do not require normalized data and therefore are known for being very fast.
	  </aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		Dataframes:
		samples pandas code to load in data and describe
		<aside class="notes">
			No matter what type of data format you're working with, you can load it into a dataframe.  Both R and the python package pandas have this type of data structure, which is pretty much a table.  You have rows, and columns and headers, like your data has.  Here's an example of a pandas data frame.  Pandas also comes with built-in functions to describe your data.
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
		Plotting
		plot
		<aside class="notes">
			Another way to explore your data is through plots.  There are some things that may be hard to see from summary statistics, but very obvious from a graph, like outliers and seasonality.  Matplotlib is a python package for plotting data.
		</aside>
	</section>
	<section>
	  Data Issues: typos, missing data, redundant data, format issues, outliers
	  <aside class="notes">
		  While you're exploring your data, you may notice some issues.  There may be typos, missing data, redundant data, format issues, or outliers.  When you notice these issues, the first step is to discuss with data provider.  You want to know things like how the data was collected, what exactly it is (sometimes the column names are misleading), if any of the data is stale or deprecated (sometimes one column was deprecated, but left in database, and replaced by a more accurate column).  This information will help you decide how to handle the various issues with the data.
	</section>
	<section>
	  Example Data:
	  Small group discussion
	  <aside class="notes">
	  		Now we're going to do a little small group exercise.  You can work with the person next to you.  Here is an example of some data with issues.  We'll give you about 5 minutes to look at it and come up with some issues that you can see.
	  </aside>

	<section>
	  <h1>Predictive analytics and machine learning</h1>
	</section>

	<section>
	  You’d like to predict whether customer activity is fraudulent. What are the steps?
	  Definitions
	  Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, statistical modeling, descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics
	  The biggest difference I see between the communities is that statistics emphasizes inference, whereas machine learning emphasized prediction. When you do statistics, you want to infer the process by which data you have was generated. When you do machine learning, you want to know how you can predict what future data will look like w.r.t. some variable.
	  http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/6/the-two-cultures-statistics-vs-machine-learning
	  We’ll focus on supervised learning
	  y vector of what we’re predicting, x vector of features
	  categorical, metric, ordinal
	  y can be categorical (classification) or numeric (regression)
	  Introduce a running example TODO: high priority!
	  Picking a model
	  List a bunch of models
	  Model we chose for this data set
	  Training
	  Feature engineering
	  Feature selection
	  training and test set
	  cross validation for parameter tuning
	  overfitting
	  Results for example
	</section>

	<section>
	  <h1>A/B testing</h1>
	</section>

	<section>
	  Your company is trying to increase click-through rates, and is trying to determine if a red banner drives more clicks than a blue one. How is this done?
	  Now you have a prediction, how to test?
	  framing testing with example
	  What is A/B testing and why would you need it?
	  EVERYONE uses A/B testing
	  examples: Amazon, etc
	  Types/models for A/B testing
	  one-armed bandit (epsilon, bayesian bandit)
	  interactive chart (evan miller blog?)
	  What NOT to do (evan miller)
	  don’t stop early
	</section>

	<section>
	  <h1>Data communication and visualization</h1>
	</section>

	<section>
	  Communication is critical for data science
	  Must be able to communicate a model to a customer/non-technical team
	  If the model does not get used/implemented, it does not add value
	  Tip 1: start simple, super simple, maintainability
	  CEO should be able to understand it (at a high level)
	  Tip 2: Translate model results into business value, ROI, etc.
	  Tip 3: Create great charts Visualization - the basics

	  <h2>Our recommended toolset</h2>
	  <h3 style="color:magenta">This is our opinion!</h3>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Python with pandas, numpy, scipy</li>
	    <li>Unix utilities</li>
	    <li>Don’t use windows</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>Note to Sara: I'm thinking of scrapping this slide, seems negative</p>
	  <p>We could scrap, or just discuss commonly used tools (python, R, excel) and pros/cons?</p>

          <p>And math typing can be placed on a separate line like this:</p>
	  <p>
               $$\frac{1}{n}\sqrt{e^\frac{1}{n} - e^\frac{1}{n+1}}\sim\frac{1}{n^2}$$

	  <p>
	    These guys come in two forms, inline: <q cite="http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/definition/Our-Favorite-Technology-Quotations">
	      &ldquo;The nice thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from&rdquo;</q> and block:
	  </p>
	  <blockquote cite="http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/definition/Our-Favorite-Technology-Quotations">
	    &ldquo;For years there has been a theory that millions of monkeys typing at random on millions of typewriters would
	    reproduce the entire works of Shakespeare. The Internet has proven this theory to be untrue.&rdquo;
	  </blockquote>

	<section>
	  <h2>Speaker View</h2>
	  <p>There's a <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#speaker-notes">speaker view</a>. It includes a timer, preview of the upcoming slide as well as your speaker notes.</p>
	  <p>Press the <em>S</em> key to try it out.</p>
	  
	  <aside class="notes">
	    Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).
