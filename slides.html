	  <h1>Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
	  <aside class="notes">
	 	The first step for any data science project is to exploratory data analysis (or EDA).  Exploring and understanding your data is crucial for your work to be effective.  If you build a model based on incorrect assumptions about your data, the model will be flawed and you might waste a lot of time trying to figure out why.  So the goal in EDA is to gain a thorough understanding of your data and locate and resolve any potential issues with your data.

	  	We're going to be working with data about passengers aboard the Titanic.  This dataset is a very popular dataset for learning data science.  You can download it from kaggle.com, which is a website that hosts data science competitions.  Also, on kaggle, you can find tutorials in R and python and lots of help in the forums.

	  <h2>Data formats</h2>
	  <img src="images/csv_format.png"/>
	  <aside class="notes">
	    Let's start with the data.  There are a number of different formats your data can be in.  These include the ever-present excel spreadsheet, a csv (comma-separated values) file, a tsv (tab-separated values) file, JSON, and more.<br>
	    Here's what a csv file would look like.  I used the built-in linux command head to print out the first 10 lines of the file.
	  </aside>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <img src="images/wordle.png"/>
	  <aside class="notes">
	    The format of your data might depend on its source.  There are many different types of databases.  One common type is a relational database, which focuses on the relationships between the data.  Examples include mySQL, SQL Server, MS Access, PostgreSQL.  This type of database requires normalization, which means that different related tables are joined (linked) so that there is no redundancy.  While this helps with data integrity, it can make the database requests slow.  An alternative would be a noSQL database, such as MongoDB, Redis, Apache Cassandra, HBase.  They do not require normalized data and therefore are known for being very fast and scalable.  A lot of these can be distributed, meaning that the data is spread across multiple machines.  This would allow you to store lots and lots of data and be able to query very quickly.

		<h2>Dataframes</h2>
			<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("../data/train.csv")
print df.head()
		    </code></pre>
		<img src="images/df_head.png"/>
		<aside class="notes">
			No matter what type of data format you're working with, you can load it into a dataframe.  Both R and the python package pandas have this type of data structure, which is pretty much a table.  You have rows, and columns and headers, like your data has.  Here's an example of a pandas data frame.
		</aside>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Summary Statistics</h2>
			<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
print df.dtypes
print df['Age'].describe()
		    </code></pre>
		<img src="images/dtypes.png">
		<img src="images/age_describe.png">
		<aside class="notes">
			One of the first things I like to do is explore the data with summary statistics.  There are a lot of built-in functions to help you with this.  You can use head to check out the first few rows.  You can use dtypes to tell you the data types of each column.  You can select a particular row and describe it, which tells you things like count, mean, max, min.
		</aside>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Plotting</h2>
		<img src="images/ex_plots.png">
		<aside class="notes">
			Another way to explore your data is through plots.  There are some things that may be hard to see from summary statistics, but very obvious from a graph, like outliers and seasonality.  There are a lot of packages for plotting.  Some of the more popular ones are ggplot for R and matplotlib for python.

	  	<h2>Data Issues</h2>
	  	<ul>
  			<li>Typos</li>
  			<li>Missing data</li>
  			<li>Redundant data</li>
  			<li>Formatting</li>
  			<li>Outliers</li>
	  	</ul>
	  	<aside class="notes">
	  		So basically with all the plots and summary stats, we're trying to understand what the data looks like and discover any possible issues.  These issues could include typos, missing data, redundant data, formatting issues, and outliers.  When you see these issues, it should be a red flag, to talk to your data provider about, so you can decide how you want to handle them.

	  		While you're exploring your data, you may notice some issues.  There may be typos, missing data, redundant data, format issues, or outliers.  When you notice these issues, the first step is to discuss with data provider.  You want to know things like how the data was collected, what exactly it is (sometimes the column names are misleading), if any of the data is stale or deprecated (sometimes one column was deprecated, but left in database, and replaced by a more accurate column).  This information will help you decide how to handle the various issues with the data.
	  	</aside>
	</section>

	<section>
	  	<h2>Example Data</h2>
	  	<img src="images/group_ex_data.png">

	  <aside class="notes">
	  		Now we're going to do a little small group exercise.  You can work with the person next to you.  Here is an example of some data with issues.  We'll give you about 5 minutes to look at it and come up with some issues that you can see.
	  </aside>
	</section>

	<section>
	  	<h2>Missing Data</h2>
			<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
df = df.drop([Cabin'], axis=1)

med_age = df.Age.median()
df.Age = df.Age.fillna(med_age)
		    </code></pre>
	  	<aside class="notes">
	  		Lots of missing data in cabin column.  But, not an obvious replacement.  Also, probably highly correlated to class and ticket fare.  So we'll disregard for now.  We can always add it back in later.<br>

	  		Next, we have to handle the missing data in the age column.  This is one that may have some significance, based on our plots, so we want to leave it in.  We could simply drop the rows that have an NA, but it might skew our data, depending on the reason the age wasn't obtained.  Another option is to replace it with a value.  Here's an example of how we would find the median age and replace the NAs with that value.
		</aside>
	</section>

	<section>
	  	<h2>Formatting & Typos</h2>
			<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
df['Fare'][19] = 7.2250

df = df.drop(['Ticket'], axis=1)
		    </code></pre>
	  	<aside class="notes">
	  		We found a potential typo in the fare of one of our passengers, so let's say we discussed it with our data provider and she researched it and confirmed it was a typo and the decimal place was in the wrong place.  So, we can just replace that cell with the correct value. <br>

	  		Another potential issue with our data was the formatting of the ticket column.  It kind of seems to be all over the place.  So we could try to standardize it, or extract some information from it.  But in this case, it's not obvious that it'll add a lot of info to our model, so we'll start out ignoring it.  We can always add it back in later to refine our model.

	  <aside class="notes">
	  		Another important area of data science is experimentation and testing.  This could be done in order to gather the data that you will use to model, or it could be done to test the predictions that your model output.  Or it could be done instead of creating a model.  Here's a quote from a HBR article from last year from Wyatt Jenkins of Shutterstock, that emphasizes the importance of testing, specifically A/B testing.

		<aside class="notes">
			So what is A/B testing?  A/B testing is an experiementation technique where you show some customers one thing (version A) and other customers another (version B).  It's commonly used in web analytics, where a company would show some percentage of the visitors to its website one layout or color scheme or ad, and others a different one.  You typically want to keep the rest of the content the same, so that you can attribute the difference in click-throughs to the the change you're testing.

		<h2>Multi-Armed Bandit</h2>
		<img src="http://www.residentialgolflessons.com/multimedia/gallery/3799_mills-golden-nugget-bandit.jpg">
		<aside class="notes">
			One common situation that's related to A/B testing is the multi-armed bandit problem.  The name comes from the idea of a slot machine or "one-armed bandit" having two arms to pull.  You may have some hypothesis of which arm would have the bigger reward, but you need to come up with a strategy that effectively tests your theory and also maximizes the reward.  So in terms of A/B testing in online ads, you would want to choose the perecentage of website visitors to show each ad that provides enough data to give confidence to your findings but also maximize click-throughs in the process.

			There are a number of different strategies you can take here.  The simpliest is called epsilon-greedy, which assigns a fixed percentage (say 90%) of the visitors to the ad that is expected to have the higher reward.  But in order to gain more information about the other ad, you may consider a probability matching strategy, such as the Bayesian bandit strategy.  You can use Bayes Theorem to come up with a prior probability, that's your starting point.  And it updates based on each new data point.

		<aside class="notes">
			An alternative to A/B testing is multivariate testing.  As the name suggests, multivariate testing tests multiple variables at the same time.  You can use a full factorial method, which would test every combination of the changes, or a partial factorial method, which would only test a fraction of the combinations and infer the rest.  While you can learn more about the effectiveness of each variable, the testing is more complex and requires more data (visitors) than A/B testing, which is sometimes not worth the effort.

		No peeking!
		<aside class="notes">
			One of the most important things to keep in mind when A/B testing is when to stop.  Generally, you want to stop testing when you reach a certain level of statistical significance.  However, this should be calculated beforehand.  Often people "peek" at their current significance, and stop when they reach a certain level.  However, this might be influenced by a current streak, for example, so it would be misleading.  So, you should calculate your sample size, based on your desired level of significance, beforehand and do not stop early.
